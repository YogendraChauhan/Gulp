# Automate Work Flow Using Gulp

This program is created for step by step learning of the gulp process to automate and enhance your workflow by preferring code over configuration, node best practices, and a minimal API surface - gulp makes things simple like never before.

## Getting Started

See deployment for notes on how gulp is helpful for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.
